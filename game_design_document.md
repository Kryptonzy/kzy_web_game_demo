# Game Design Document: Somnium Weavers: Endless Echoes (Tentative Title)

## 1. Game Overview

*   **Logline:** A "dream exploration" focused tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) where players, as "Dreamwalkers," adventure through diverse dreamscapes. Their choices and experiences within dreams manifest as tangible "Dream Fragments" (souvenirs/quest items) in the waking world, potentially influencing their real-world destiny or unlocking new abilities.
*   **Core Experience:** Exploring the unknown, experiencing diverse lives, shaping destiny through choices, the interweaving of reality and dreams.
*   **Target Audience:**
    *   Players who enjoy TRPGs with high freedom and strong narrative elements.
    *   Players interested in a wide range of genres (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, slice-of-life, historical, etc.).
    *   Players who appreciate "choice and consequence" mechanics and want their actions to have long-term impact.
    *   Creative DMs/KPs (Dungeon Masters/Keepers).

## 2. Core Concepts & USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)

*   **Limitless Dreamscapes:**
    *   The themes, rules, and physical laws of dreams can be infinitely varied, guided by the DM or co-created with players (even with LLM assistance). They can range from epic fantasy, cyberpunk metropolises, Lovecraftian horror, heartwarming slice-of-life vignettes, to historical reenactments.
    *   Every entry into a dream is a fresh experience.
*   **Echoes of Dreams:**
    *   **Core Mechanic:** Key choices made, special items obtained, or significant events experienced by players in dreams will materialize in the waking world as "Dream Fragments" (Souvenirs/Echoes) upon waking.
    *   **Fragment Types:**
        *   **Mementos:** Primarily items of emotional value or minor functional use (e.g., a dream-flower that never wilts, a quill that writes in strange scripts).
        *   **Quest Items/Clues:** Directly related to real-world tasks or unsolved mysteries (e.g., a stone tablet inscribed with unknown symbols, a broken compass pointing in a specific direction).
        *   **Ability Shards:** Temporary or permanent enhancements to real-world abilities or new skills (e.g., swordsmanship learned in a dream leaves muscle memory in reality, forbidden knowledge read in a dream allows deciphering ancient texts in the waking world).
        *   **Bond Marks:** Deep connections forged with dream NPCs or teammates, which might lead to reunions or their assistance in the real world.
*   **The Waking World Anchor:**
    *   Players share a common "waking world" background. This reality might itself be full of mysteries, or the players might have been drawn into "dream exploration" for a specific reason.
    *   "Dream Fragments" are the key link between dreams and reality, used to solve real-world problems, advance the main storyline, or improve players' circumstances in reality.
*   **Dream Logic & Lucidity:**
    *   Dreams can operate under unique "dream logic," allowing for surreal actions.
    *   Players can have a "Lucidity" stat. High lucidity means players are more aware they are dreaming and can even attempt to exert limited influence over the dream (requiring resource expenditure or skill checks).

## 3. Gameplay Systems

### 3.1 Character Creation
*   **Waking Identity:** Players first create their "waking world" identity, including basic attributes, skills, background story, and an initial "motivation for dreaming" or "real-world predicament."
*   **Dream Affinity:** Characters might possess innate dream affinities, influencing their performance in specific dream types or their initial lucidity.

### 3.2 Core Loop
1.  **Waking Phase:**
    *   Organize and analyze "Dream Fragments."
    *   Use fragments to advance real-world tasks, interact with NPCs, purchase equipment, etc.
    *   Decide on the goal or direction for the next dream entry (if player-selectable).
2.  **Dream Entry (Preparation/Ritual):**
    *   Could be natural sleep, or require specific conditions, items, or rituals.
    *   DM describes the transition scene into the dream.
3.  **Dream Exploration:**
    *   DM presents the dream's theme, environment, and encounters.
    *   Players explore, interact, combat, and solve puzzles.
    *   Emphasis on choice and role-playing; actions in the dream directly affect "Dream Fragment" acquisition.
    *   **LLM Assistance:** DM can use LLMs to quickly generate dream descriptions, NPC dialogue, random events, and puzzle ideas.
4.  **Dream Climax & Choice:**
    *   Each dream typically features a core event or decision point.
    *   Player choices directly determine the dream's outcome and the potential "Dream Fragments" obtained.
5.  **Awakening & Harvest:**
    *   DM describes the awakening process; players take stock of "Dream Fragments" acquired from this dream.
    *   Record any immediate impacts on the real world (e.g., new scars, new knowledge).

### 3.3 "Dream Fragment" System (Echoes System)
*   **Acquisition:** Completing dream objectives, making specific choices, defeating powerful foes, discovering hidden secrets, deeply interacting with specific NPCs, etc.
*   **Identification & Interpretation:** Some fragments may require players to research, interpret, or have them appraised in the waking world to understand their true purpose.
*   **Combination & Upgrading:** Certain fragments might have connections, allowing them to be combined for new effects or to upgrade existing fragments.
*   **Consumable & Permanent:** Some fragments are single-use, while others provide lasting effects.

### 3.4 Rule Core
*   Recommend a relatively lightweight and flexible resolution system (e.g., a d6 or d10 attribute + skill dice pool, or a simple success-level system).
*   Design specific check rules for "Lucidity" and "Influencing the Dream."
*   The DM has the final say on dream rules, encouraging improvisation.

### 3.5 Waking World Progression
*   There might be an overarching main storyline in the waking world (e.g., investigating why they are collectively experiencing these special dreams, or combating a nightmare entity trying to corrupt reality).
*   "Dream Fragments" are key to advancing this main story.

## 4. Narrative & Worldbuilding

*   **Waking World Setting:**
    *   Is it a modern city? Near future? Or a fantasy world already filled with its own wonders?
    *   Why were the players chosen/do they possess this ability? Was it an accident? A curse? Or a mission?
*   **Nature of Dreams:**
    *   Are they merely subconscious projections? Or do they connect to other dimensions, the collective unconscious, or even divine realms?
    *   Is there a connection between different dreams?
*   **Potential Conflicts & Themes:**
    *   The boundary between reality and illusion.
    *   The cost and responsibility of choices.
    *   The meaning of memory, identity, and existence.
    *   The fear/allure of exploration and the unknown.
*   **LLM Application in Narrative:**
    *   **Diverse Dream Generation:** Based on DM-input keywords (e.g., "Gothic castle, vampire hunter, full moon"), the LLM can quickly generate the dream's setting, main conflict, key NPCs, and characteristic scenes.
    *   **"Dream Fragment" Descriptions:** LLMs can generate mysterious and imaginative descriptions for acquired fragments.
    *   **NPC Personalization:** Especially for one-off, functional NPCs in dreams, LLMs can quickly give them unique personalities and dialogue styles.

## 5. Attractive Dream Themes - Examples

*   **Epic Dragon Slaying:** Classic fantasy. Players act as heroes battling a dragon in an ancient castle or on a mountaintop. Fragments could be "Dragon Scale Armor Shard" (provides protection in reality) or "Dragonslayer's Courage" (temporarily boosts willpower in reality).
*   **Cyberpunk Megacity Hunt:** Players are bounty hunters tracking a dangerous cyborg in a neon-drenched future city. Fragments might be "Advanced Optic Implant Fragment" (enhances perception in reality) or an "Encrypted Data Chip" (contains a corporation's secrets in reality).
*   **Abyssal Voyage:** Exploring eerie deep seas and encountering unknown Lovecraftian creatures. Fragments could be a "Deep Dweller's Journal" (reveals an ancient secret in reality) or a "Tainted Coral" (may bring negative effects but also has special uses in reality).
*   **Royal Court Intrigue:** Navigating the politics of an ancient dynasty's court, uncovering conspiracies, or supporting a prince's claim. Fragments might be a "Royal Secret Missive" (evidence against an important figure in reality) or a "Courtesan's Fan" (enhances social charm in reality).
*   **Surreal Puzzle Realm:** Entering a world made of abstract concepts and paradoxes, escaping through puzzle-solving. Fragments could be a "Key of Logic" (can unlock a cipher in reality) or a "Moment of Epiphany" (permanently boosts an intelligence-related skill).
*   **Extraordinary in the Ordinary:** Dreaming of childhood, only to discover miracles or dangers hidden beneath mundane daily life. Fragments might be a "Lost Toy Soldier" (can evoke a forgotten key memory in reality) or a "Guardian's Promise" (grants protection once under specific circumstances in reality).

## 6. LLM Integration Strategy

*   **DM's Super Assistant:**
    *   **Content Generation:** Dream descriptions, NPC backgrounds and dialogue, item descriptions, puzzle design, random events.
    *   **Creative Inspiration:** When the DM is stuck, they can query the LLM for plot development suggestions or new dream themes.
    *   **Rule Lookup & Explanation:** Explaining general concepts.
*   **Personalized Experience:**
    *   Based on the player's real-world background or held "Dream Fragments," the LLM can assist in generating more targeted dream content or NPC interactions.
*   **Tool-Based Integration:**
    *   Ideally, a DM assistant tool with an integrated LLM interface, allowing DMs to call LLM functions with simple commands.
    *   For example, DM inputs "/dream_generate theme:steampunk, location:sky_island, conflict:airship_pirates," and the LLM returns a basic framework for a steampunk sky island dream with airship pirates.

## 7. Potential Risks & Mitigation

*   **DM Workload:** Despite LLM assistance, conceptualizing and linking dreams with reality still requires DM effort.
    *   *Mitigation:* Provide clear frameworks and tools, encourage DMs to use LLMs to reduce repetitive work.
*   **"Dream Fragment" Balance:** Fragments that are too powerful or too weak can affect the game experience.
    *   *Mitigation:* Offer fragment design guidelines, emphasize the DM's final judgment, and encourage fragment diversity over sheer power.
*   **Repetitiveness or Disconnectedness of Dream Themes:** If dreams are entirely unrelated, players might feel a lack of an overall goal.
    *   *Mitigation:* Suggest setting an overarching mystery or objective in the waking world, so all dream rewards contribute to it.
*   **Over-reliance on LLM:** May lead to a decline in DM creativity.
    *   *Mitigation:* Emphasize that the LLM is an auxiliary tool, and the DM remains the primary storyteller.

## 8. Conclusion

"Somnium Weavers: Endless Echoes," with its "Limitless Dreamscapes" diversity and unique "Echoes of Dreams" mechanic, has the potential to be a highly engaging and replayable TRPG. Through carefully designed waking world anchors and clever use of "Dream Fragments," seemingly disparate dream adventures can be woven into a deeply narrative long-form campaign. The integration of Large Language Models can significantly enhance DM creative efficiency and the richness of dream worlds, offering players an unprecedented immersive experience.

This GDD provides an initial framework. Actual development will require further refinement of rules, balancing, and writing sample modules. However, the core "dream-reality-fragment" loop and the auxiliary role of LLMs are key to its success.
